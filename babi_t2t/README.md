# `torch_t2t_train.py`

This is basically a file that I have started to work on in free time. It's not part of the project in
any official way. It is a work in progress.

# `torch_t2t_transformer_train.py`, `torch_t2t_transformer_preprocess.py`, `torch_t2t_transformer_test.py`

This is code from another source that uses pytorch to build a transformer model that works as does the
transformer from the original paper 'attention is all you need'. It's also a work in progress and not
officially part of the project.
